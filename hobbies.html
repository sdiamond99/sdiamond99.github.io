				<h2>Choir</h2>
				<p>I have enjoyed singing since I was little, so I enjoyed  joining choir at school. I have been a part of the schools' choir since 2nd grade.
				Sophomore year, I was placed into Advanced Choir. My group traveled in and out of state for competition. Our school was know to have high scores in
					the district.In senior year of high school, I was the leader of my vocal range and helped the entire class with songs when we did not have a
					director. I have also sang for a church a few times.</p>
				<h2>Cosplay</h2>
				<p>In middle school, I started cosplaying (costume play) for fun. I started making costumes customized for me and sometimes commissioned from my friends
				to help design their cosplays. I would sit for months sometimes just for sewing a piece. The cosplay pieces I have done are:
					Skull Kid from Majoras Mask, Victor Nikiforov from Yuri!!! On Ice, and Kagamine Rin from Alice in Musicland, Matryoshka, and Trick
					and Treat.</p>
				<h2>Video Game Design</h2>
				<p>I decided to become a video game designer July 11, 2015. I enjoy designning storylines and characters. I recently started on working on
				my very first game called "M".</p>
